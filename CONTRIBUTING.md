I'm happy to welcome all the contributions from anyone willing to add new scripts to this repository. Thank you for helping out and remember,

       ```

       ```
* Step 2: Add a new branch to the main branch( git branch command tells on which branch you are)
    ```

it is an Issue or a Pull Request.

7. Each participant / contributor will be **assigned 1 issue (max)** at a time to work.
